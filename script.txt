The quantum wave function explained
===================================

Quantum Mechanics explained using an actual wave function
Part 1 - Single particle
------------------------

This is a particle. It could be a single electron, a hydrogen atom or even a water molecule moving really slowly.
[#1 animation of a spreading gaussian wave function.]

Well actually according to the Copenhagen interpretation (#2 animation of a small dot blibbing into existence) this is a particle. Or this, or this, ... (#2 animation of intensifying blibs forming a gaussian). The amplitude of the wave function only defines a probability distribution of possible measurements for the location of the particle.

[#1 back to spreading gaussian wave]
However, according to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics this is a good description of reality. It is only an approximation to the quantum fields of the standard model, but suffices for our purposes.

You may notice that I've drawn stripes on the wavefunction. This represents something called phase and cannot be directly measured. What can be measured is how closely the stripes are packed and is called the momentum (or speed) of the particle. Measuring this stripyness is a mathematical trick called a Fourier Transform and is not part of the wave function itself. [#3 gaussian boosted to the right] Using this trick we can derive the so called Heisenberg uncertainty principle that gives us limits on how well we can measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. [#4 gaussian boosted diagonally] It cannot be stressed enough that the speed of a particle is not a fundamental feature of reality. [#5 weird shapes doing wavy stuff] What is the speed of this configuration? This funny shape is a valid solution to the Schrödinger equation and there certainly is no single direction into which it's going.

[#5 two humps (of different size?) moving towards each other (separate solutions overlaid)]
Let's talk about superposition. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the wave function represents our uncertainty about its location so there's nothing weird about a superposition. We just don't know if the particle is on the left [#6 blib] or on the right [...blib]. Where it gets interesting is when this quantum uncertainty interferes with itself. [#5 advanced to the point where we start to see waves] The Schrödinger equation tells us that sometimes the wavefunction amplifies itself and sometimes suppresses itself. It all depends on the phase relation of the parts of the superposition. [#5 manipulating the phase of one of the humps] The crests of the interference waves will move, but they will always be there. These interference patterns can be measured by carefully repeating the experiment many times [#7 blib blib blib] so they are very much real even if you consider the wave function to be metaphysical non-sense. One final point: I'm careful to use to word "interfere" instead of "interact". The two moving humps of quantum uncertainty pass through each other unchanged. Different superpositions of the same particle cannot affect each other, they only interfere with the measurements.

[#8 particle moving towards a "high" wall diagonally]
Now let's talk about quantum tunneling. Sensational coverage of Quantum Physics talks about particles behaving like ghosts passing through walls. The truth is that there are no real walls at the quantum level. There are these things called called potentials and they can have low or high energy. At no point does the energy become "too high" to overcome in an absolute sense. Here we just saw a particle bouncing off a high energy potential. [#9 particle moving diagonally over a weak potential wall] This time the potential has low energy so more of the wave function gets through. Just look at that. Beautiful interference patterns emerge when the particle interacts with the potential and the boundary of the box.

[#10 Particle drifting towards a single slit]
It's soon time for the infamous double slit experiment, but let's look at a single slit at first. I've prepared a high energy potential with a hole in it so that we can focus on the interaction with the obstacle without having to worry about tunneling effects. ((It's a pretty picture but we can see that all of the waves that form are very small and)) We can see that the particle mostly passes through the slit even if some of the waves reflect back.

[#11 Particle drifting towards a double slit]
If we add a second slit something wonderful happens. The resulting waves from the slits interfere and form this beautiful pattern.

[#12 Drifting particle about to be measured]
Now we've seen what a double slit potential actually does to the wave function of a particle, but what does this mean experimentally. What kind of an experiment could we actually perform? What is a measurement anyway? The wave function represents the probability of detecting a particle at a certain location at a certain time, but what happens after? This is where it gets controversial and we get to debate something called the collapse of the wave function. A parsimonious proponent of the Copenhagen interpretation would say there is no meaning to the wave function after measurement. It is a tool to be used once and then discarded. A careful many-world theorist would ask how exactly are you going to perform the measurement. What are you putting into the system that eventually couples it with a macroscopic measurement device. We're going to talk about this more in the next episode when we analyze quantum entanglement. For now it suffices to say that you don't need to destroy or collapse the system to get useful information out of it. The collapse of the wave function is something we postulate on top of the Schrödinger equation. No-one has ever done an experiment that would indicate a spontaneous collapse of the wave function. It always depends on the fine details of the measuring equipment.
So let's do it anyway! [#12 clipped to a circle off-center] Boom! Now that's certainly a mess. Let's do it again! [#12 rewound and clipped to the complement of the circle] Oh dear... Our poor particle. To collapse a wave function you need to pump a lot of energy in the system. In the naive many-worlds interpretation this splits reality into two versions that then evolve in parallel. [#13 measurement results and side by side evolutions of #12] A careful analysis of the universal wave function tells us that no such discrete splits ever occur. The quantum fields ebb and flow smoothly and there is always more to it than a simple either-or result. This kind of appearance of a wave function collapse requires a well shaped high energy beam that is sure to disrupt our gentle particle.
[#14 Drifting particle about to be measured into superposition]
Let's do more! Now with a more "interesting" measurement. By measuring if the particle is anywhere inside these weird shapes we actually force it into being there. This is called the Quantum Zeno Effect and has been experimentally verified. Again a careful analysis would reveal how the measurement aparatus couples to the quantum particle without having to invoke a total collapse of the wave function.

[#13 Back to the double slit]
Back to the double slit experiment. Any measurement is going to disrupt the system so we're going to use following scheme: [#13 with boxes at the back wall] Once any of these detectors click we reset the experiment. This is the interference pattern that was seen in 1927. Now let's put a detector into one of the slits to see which way the particle actually went. As we can see. The detectors disrupt the wave function even when they detect nothing! When we model measurement as the collapse of the wave function a non-detecting detector in one of the slits pushes the particle into the other slit and the interference pattern dissapears.
