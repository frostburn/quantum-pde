The quantum wave function explained
===================================

Quantum Mechanics explained using an actual wave function

I recently watched a documentary on quantum mechanics and was frustrated by how they made everything sound weird, mysterious or even spooky. This kind of sensational language obscures the fact that we're dealing with phenomena that obey well-defined laws of physics that we can simulate on a computer. In this video I hope to dispel some of the mystery using clear animations of the quantum wave function and compare it with everyday classical physics.

Part 1 - Single particle
------------------------

[#1 animation of a spreading gaussian wave function without phase lines]
This is a particle. It could be a single electron, a hydrogen atom or even a water molecule moving very slowly.

[#2 animation of wave function being measured per pixel]
Well actually, according to the Copenhagen interpretation we should be talking about individual measurements. The amplitude of the wave function defines a probability distribution for the location of the particle and only by repeating the experiment millions of times can we see the pattern.

[#3 back to spreading gaussian wave now with phase lines]
However, according to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics the image we see here is a good description of reality. While it is only an approximation to the quantum fields of the standard model, it still suffices for our purposes.

You may notice that I've drawn stripes on the wave function. They represents something called phase. The closer the stripes are packed together the faster the wave function spreads across them.

[#4 two classical humps of different size]
Let's talk about superposition. There's nothing weird about it. Here we have sampled a from a bimodal distribution for a classical particle. Each gray dot represents a possible trajectory of the particle. Superposition simply means that we're not sure if the particle is actually on the left or on the right. There is also general uncertainty about the exact location and speed of the particle.

[#5 wave function superposition]
In the quantum world there are two main differences. The first is that the rate at which the wave function spreads is inversely proportional to its initial size. If we're initially sure that the particle is in a small area, it will spread out quickly, while if we're generally unsure of where the particle might be it tends to stay that way without spreading further. Another difference compared to classical uncertainty is that quantum uncertainty interferes with itself producing a pattern where different parts amplify and other parts suppress the chance of finding the particle in a particular location.

[#6 previous interference pattern measured per pixel]
If we repeat this experiment millions of times and measure where the particle is we get this pattern. Self-interference is a real phenomenon even if we use the Copenhagen interpretation and insist that the wave function is just a tool and not an actual description of reality.

[#7 two humps moving towards each other]
One final point: I'm careful to use to word "interfere" instead of "interact". The two moving humps of quantum uncertainty pass through each other unchanged. Different superpositions of the same particle cannot affect each other, they only interfere with the measurements.

[#8 two classical humps moving towards each other]
We can see this non-interaction in the classical case as well. We're simply not sure if the particle is on the left and moving to the right or on the right moving in the opposite direction. In the end it's just a single particle and our uncertainty about it cannot cause it to self-interact.

[#9 slow particle moving towards a barrier]
Now let's talk about tunneling. Sensational coverage of Quantum Physics talks about particles behaving like ghosts passing through walls. The truth is that there are no such things as "walls" at the atomic level. There are simply energy barriers that are easy or hard to overcome. If the particle is moving slowly like this it will bounce back.

[#10 fast particle moving over a barrier]
If the particle is moving fast it will pass through the barrier with little effect.

[#11 particle moving at just the right speed for a 50-50 split]
However if the speed is just right, a portion of the wave function will go through and the rest will reflect back.

[#12 classical hump moving towards a barrier just right]
Besides some minor self-interference there's nothing "quantum" about this tunneling behaviour. Even our classical particle will sometimes go over the barrier and sometimes reflect back if the speed distribution is just right. A portion of the trajectories even comes to a near-stop on top of the barrier.

[#13 Particle drifting towards a single slit]
Soon it's time for the infamous double slit experiment, but let's look at a single slit first. I've prepared a high energy potential with a hole in it so that we can focus on the interaction with the obstacle without having to worry about tunneling effects. Most of the waves reflect back and the jet that goes through doesn't do anything special beyond spreading wider than you'd expect.

[#13 Particle drifting towards a double slit]
If we add a second slit something wonderful happens. The resulting jets from the slits interfere and form this beautiful pattern. This is something that only happens with waves that can self-interfere and has been experimentally verified by shooting single electrons at a metal plate with two slits cut into it.

[#14 Classical double slit]
When we contrast this with the classical case we only get two sharp jets that do not interfere.

[#15 Classical measurement inside a square]
Now let’s talk about measurements. In the classical case the situation is clear. If we learn that the particle is somewhere inside this square, we can erase all trajectories outside. Eventually the remaining uncertainty makes the image blurry again.

[#16 Classical measurement outside a square]
Conversely if we learn that the particle is not inside the square, we can eliminate that area from consideration. Our knowledge does not affect individual trajectories.

[#17 Quantum particle about to be measured]
This is not the case with our quantum particle. There is no notion of an individual trajectory or a single path that the particle takes. The wave function is all there is and anything we do to it affects the dynamics of the system. The classical model of measurement motivates an approach where we collapse the wave function to reflect our state of knowledge. This however pumps a large amount of energy into the system making it a very crude approximation to a realistic measurement scenario.
[#17 Continued... measurement happens]
Once we do the measurement, we can see a shockwave propagating from the edge of the measuring area. There is no way of disentangling information and dynamics at the quantum level. Measuring quantum particles is subtle business because you have to do it with other quantum particles. A more careful analysis will have to wait for part 2 of this series where we will talk about quantum entanglement.
[#18 inverted quantum measurement]
It makes no difference if we learn that the particle is outside of the square area. We still get a shockwave that wouldn't be there if we left the system alone. It's important to note that collapsing the wave function is something extra that we postulate on top of the Schrödinger Equation which governs the evolution of the wave function. No spontaneous collapse has ever been observed as far as I know.

[#19 Double slit experiment about to measured on a single slit]
So with these caveats in mind let's return to the double slit experiment and place a measurement area into one of the slits. We're going to measure if there is a particle in the slit multiple times. This simulation corresponds to the case where we never observe the particle going through the slit yet still we see a dramatic effect: The interference pattern disappears. Even when we never catch the particle with a measurement we change the dynamics of the system drastically.

[#20 Quantum particle in a convex mirror]
I hope that these simulations have illuminated some of the aspects of quantum mechanics and shown that many of the features of the wave function besides self-interference have direct counterparts in classical physics that can be understood as consequences of our uncertainty about the system. As a bonus I'd like to show how a convex mirror can momentarily reduce our uncertainty about the system by focusing the wave function.

[#21 Classical particle in a convex mirror]
The same effect can be observed in the classical scenario. It's not always the case that uncertainty must increase.

[#22 Particle in a box with stuff]
The quantum world is a subtle one, but it is not inherently mysterious or unknowable. In the next episode we'll take a look at multiple quantum particles and their interactions. I'll leave you with this: Even a single particle in a box with a few obstacles creates these intricate patterns. Through simulation we can see the unseen, even when our everyday notions of location and speed start to break down.
